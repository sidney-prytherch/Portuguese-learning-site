# portuguese-learning-site

Everything here, I typed up from Living Language's book on learning Brazilian Portuguese, and the audio clips are from the CD that came with the book.

Currently there are only Vocabulary sections (word-list, phrase-list, sentence-list, and conversations) and nuts-and-bolts sections (Practice sections aren't yet implemented). These are from Units 1-6. The buttons on the bottom of the menu don't do anything yet too.

Ultimately, I want the site to recommend content to review/play a game with based on timestamps of when users last reviewed certain things and whether or not they got them correct or not. I'm a ways from this goal though.
