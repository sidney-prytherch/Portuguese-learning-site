Among friends, or even colleagues, it's customary for women to *beijar* (_to kiss_) each other as well as male friends and relatives on both cheeks. Brazilians may also give each other *um abraço* (_a hug_) when saying good-bye. Speaking of physical contact, it's common for friends or colleagues to stand quite close and to touch one another lightly when speaking."

It's always a great idea to play with the dictionaries and translators, because this increases your vocabulary. Start a Portuguese Journal and write down the words and expressions you discover. As you learn how to use verbs and form more complex sentences, you can even start jotting down a few sentences about your day, your family, your job...your life, in Portuguese!"

Look up their Portuguese equivalents in a dictionary or online reference, and write the new words on labels. Then, label the objects, along with *o* or *a*, depending on gender. You could also practice the plurals. For example, on the refrigerator put a note that says *a geladeira*/*as geladeiras*. Every time you see the Portuguese words, say them aloud for practice. Before you know it, you'll have added those words to your vocabulary."

					"text": "The Brazilian family is a very tightly knit group. This can be seen in a few ways. For example, children typically live with their parents until they get married, and even then, in some less prosperous households, the newlyweds will live with one set of in-laws. Also, Brazilians don't usually \"go off\" to college. They stay in their hometown, and they choose a university they can attend while living with their parents who, in most cases, would not have it any other way, especially where daughters are concerned. Finally families typically get together every Sunday for a lunch with a large part of the extended family. This usually starts at around 1:00 P.M., and it goes on until the soccer games begin on TV around 3:00 P.M."

Make phrases such as *o carro novo* (_the new car_), being careful of course to use the right adjective agreement. Then decide whether you're describing a permanent characteristic or a more temporary situation, and add the verb *ser* or *estar* to form complete sentences. Use your dictionary or an online reference to help you expand your vocabulary."

					"text": "As you learned in Unit 1, entering new words into a journal can be a great way to expand your vocabulary. Now try adding to those words. Use a number or an adjective, or use the new words in a sentence. Then write the translation, and add notes on any important information about the new word, like the pronunciation, gender, and so on. Next, think of a synonym and an antonym. You'll see that in no time, you'll have acquired an amazing range of new words. It's easier to learn words when they're linked to others (i.e., chunks of language) than when they stand alone, because it's easier to remember things in context."

					"text": "Different cultures have very different relationships with the clock. Of course, statements like \"Brazilians are not punctual\" are gross generalizations, and they're unfair to the countless individuals who pay careful attention to being on time. But still, speaking in generalizations, it's probably fair to say that punctuality is not as prized a character trait in Brazil as it is in many English-speaking cultures. This observation is the fodder of anthropology papers, psychological analyses, cross-cultural studies, and of course jokes made at the expense of Cariocas, the inhabitants of Rio de Janeiro, who are perhaps the Brazilian champtions of tardiness. Paulistas, people from São Paulo and the traditional rivals of Cariocas, would like to think of themselves as punctual, but their punctuality would probably still not pass muster with most Americans. There may be some perfectly understandable reasons for this tendency toward tardiness. For example, traffic in most big cities is chaotic, and traffic delays are often offered as excuses for tardiness. Setting aside the question of whether traffic is _really_ behind all of the tardiness, a good piece of advice is that you should expect some degree of tardiness when making appointments with Brazilians for social events. For example, Brazilians usually arrive 30 minutes late for dinner at someone's home, and possibly one hour late from a party. The etiquette for social situations is: *antes tarde do que nunca* (_better late than never!_)\nKeep in mind, though, these rules don't apply to business situations. If you're traveling to Brazil on business, you should be on time for your appointments, and you should expect Brazilians to be on time as well. In that respect Brazil follows global business norms; punctuality is expected."

Finally, make a list comparing both."

In fact, you probably already know a little bossa nova, like *Garota de Ipanema* (_Girl from Ipanema_), *Águas de Março* (_Waters of March_), *Insensatez* (_How Insensitive_), and *Desadinado* (_Out of Tune_). It's relatively easy to sing along to bossa nova because of its slow and melodious cadence, and it certainly is a lot of fun, so try to get a bossa nova CD that comes with the lyrics, or download a song and do an internet search for its lyrics. To get you started, here are a few links that will give you great information, a bit of history, and suggestions for good musicians to help you fall in love with this uniquely Brazilian musical style, if you haven't already!\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=251\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jazz\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bossa_nova"

					"text": "An Anglicism is the use of an English word in another language. In both Brazil and Portugal this trend has been making inroads for decades. The main reason for this is that new technologies have come mostly from the United States, and the Portuguese language is sometimes slow to coin new terms for these advancements. As a result, by the time a new technology or device gets a Portuguese name, its English name has already become entrenched, either out of habit or sometimes because words in English are considered more distinctive. Whatever the reason, the incorporation of all these English names and terms happens, some believe, to the detriment of the Portuguese language, giving rise to sentences like: *No brazil você já pode navegar na _internet_ num _cybercafé_ que tenha um _hotspot_ _wireless_ para ler o seu _e-mail_, para visitar _sites_ come _blogs_, ou para fazer _downloads_. Mas cuidado com os _pop-ups_ e com os _spams_ na _web_!* (_In Brazil you can already surf the web in an internet café that has a wireless hotspot to read your e-mails, or visit sites with blogs or to download stuff. But be careful with the pop-ups or span on the web!_)\nBut not all internet-related vocabulary comes from English. Here's a list of common terms, some of which are related to English, and some of which aren't: *internet* (_internet_), *cibercafé* (_cybercafé_), *hotspot* (_hotspot/Wi-Fi access area_), *sem fio* (_wireless_), *correio eletrônico* (_e-mail_), *sítio* (site), *blog* (_blog_), *baixar* (_to download_), *pop-up* (_pop-up_), *spam* (_spam_), *rede* (_web, network_).\nAnd, in case you think that English is somehow immune to borrowing from other languages, think again. English has been called the \"vacuum cleaner\" of languages, gobbling up words from languages all over the world without shame or remorse. Of course, Portuguese is one of them:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_words_of_Portuguese_origin\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_words_of_International_origin"

					"text": "Flex-fuel cars, cars that run on either ethanol (made from sugarcane) or gasoline or both, mixed in any proportion, have been on the Brazilian market since 2003. These dual-fuel cars account for more than 77% of Brazilian vehincles, and that proportion has been growing at a steady pace. Seven out of every ten cars sold are flex-fuel cars, and more than half of the 30,000 service stations in the country are equipped to supply cars with ethanol as well as gasoline.\nBrazil began its alternative fuel program more than twenty years ago after the oil crisis of the 1970s. It now has the cheapest ehtanol in the world thanks, in part, to the genetically engineered sucrose-rish sugarcane crop. The benefits aren't just environmental, either. Not only is alcohol less polluting than gasoline, it's also cheaper for the consumer than gasoline. No wonder has sold more than 2 million of these cars."

					"text": "*Feiras livres* are open-air/street markets that are an essential part of the everyday lives of the people of both Brazil and Portugal. In Brazil, the *fairas livres* started out in colonial Rio de Janeiro in the late 1700s, in the port area. Local fishermen set up stands to sell the catch of the day. They're come a long way since those days, and now they supply the public with everything form local seafood to imported fish and shellfish to all varieties of meats, from every imaginable kind of fruit and vegetable, tropical and otherwise, to an incredible assortment of flowers and plants, from pots and pans to clothing and services such as shining shoes and re-caning of wicker furniture. A stroll through one of these markets is an incredible journey among the variety of immigrant populations in Brazil. You'll hear a veritable Babel of accents, especially in the markets of south and southeast. There you'll see first-, second-, and third-generation Japonese, the dominant green-belt farmers, alongside people of German and Italian descent, and migrants from the north and northeast advertising their wares at the  top of their lungs, and crafting witty come-ons to lure passerby. While you walk around, and there may be a lot of walking involved since these markets can stretch over several blocks, you can sip some *caldo de cana* (_sugarcane juice_), made fresh from long green sugarcanes in presses that can resemble Rube Goldberg contraptions. This is the same sugarcane that makes ethanol and *cachaça*, the local rum. Have fun, be careful of pickpockets, and be sure to *pechinchar* (_bargain_)! The following link will help you find open-air street markets if you're visiting Rio or Portugal.\nwww.rio.rj.gov.br/clf/feiras\nwww.portugaltravelguide.com/pt/lx/shop.htm"
